# 🌐 Personal Portfolio

**A personal portfolio website built with Next.js — developed using Claude AI agent in VS Code.**  
This project was an experiment in AI-assisted development: I directed the architecture, design decisions, and content, while Claude handled the majority of the code.

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development

This project was built using **Claude AI agent in VS Code** as the primary coding assistant.

The workflow looked like this:
- **Me** — architecture decisions, design direction, content, prompting, and review
- **Claude** — writing the majority of the code based on my requirements and feedback

This reflects my honest approach to modern development: AI accelerates the process, but understanding what's being built and why is always on me. Every component was reviewed, tested, and adjusted to meet my vision.

> *"AI assists me, but the decisions are mine."*
